Asset Bridge gives you access to the entire combined libraries of Polyhaven.com
and AmbientCG.com, with more to come in the future.

## Directly in the asset browser

Simply choose the asset you want to download and place it in your scene, and the
addon will automatically download it in the background. Once it is downloaded,
it will be instantly imported into your file, ready to be used!

## 10x faster than downloading the assets normally

Less time spent finding and downloading assets, more time to be creative.

Normal:

1. Open webbrowser
2. Go to an asset website
3. Look for the asset you want
4. Download the zip file
5. Move the zip to a better folder
6. Unzip the file
7. Import the asset into Blender
8. Place it into your scene

Asset Bridge:

1. Find the asset you want in the asset browser
2. Place it in your scene
3. Done!

## Support the asset creators

30% of the all profits from the addon go to the creators of the assets, without
whom, the addon couldn't exist. This will help ensure that the assets remain
available to everyone long into the future, and that the assets can continue to
grow.

## But wait, there's more!

### Powerful viewport controls

Once you've imported an asset, you then have access to a multitude of powerful
features such as anti-tiling, displacement and color changes right in the
sidebar of the 3D viewport.

### Full quality control

You can choose the quality of the asset that you want to download right in the
asset browser, so you can save hard drive space, and use the quality you need
for each scene. You can even change the quality of an asset _after_ it's been
imported!

### Save hard drive space for your projects

With asset bridge, only the assets that you use are actually downloaded. Before
that, every asset in the asset browser is just a placeholder, that doesn't take
up any disk space.
